# angular-portfolio-api-ready
 
This project is a fork of [PersonalPortfoliAngular](https://github.com/mehulk05/Personal-Portfolio-Angular-Updated)

## Fork Reasons

- I don't like to touch html every time for a change of the contens
- So I implemeted an API Layer (json assets) for the UI Contents
- You cannot rebuild every time your site. You can change the json (or the DB information)

## Json & DTO 

The files json are in the folder **/src/assets/json**
If you change the JSON schema, you MUST change also the DTO in **/src/app/dto** folder.

## Other?
If you need other contents or features, write me or open a ticket! 

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
